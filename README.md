Hi there!  I am using LLMs to generate code to solve the ARC prize!  

I have no illusions of really competing as I am not a programmer by trade, but this is super fun and I am learning a lot along the way.

This repo contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks and other artifacts I've generated on my way to building out all of the components needed to compete in the ARC challenges.

There are some fun toy experiments in here like LLMsChatting.  I had too much fun with this and went off on a tangent making an adult version.  You were warned!
I am using LM Studio to host LLMs locally.  You will see those references in the code.

That's it for now!
